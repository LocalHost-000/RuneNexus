            Listing your server has never been easier! The first step in getting your server listed is by logging in RuneAd, 
            which can be done by navigating to the top of RuneAd.com and clicking the "Sign in/ Register" button. 
            We require a Discord account in order to use our services. Once logged in, you will notice your discord username 
            at the top right of the webpage, hover over your name in and you will see "My Profile". 
            This is your RuneAd profile page that you will see different information based on your RuneAd time. 
            To add your RSPS from your profile page, simply click "Add Server", which will bring you to a form to fill out 
            with your server information. Private information about your servers such as the IP and Port will be hidden 
            from the public, but viewable only by the owner of the server listing. Once you are finished filling out the 
            form for your server, click the "create listing" button and this will put your listing on RuneAd. <br>
            There are two ways to use the backend voting of RuneAd. We have our own API which can be found 
            <a href="https://runead.com/docs" target="_blank">Here</a>. RuneAd is also listed on 
            <a href="https://everythingrs.com" target="_blank">EverythingRS</a>, information on how to set that up is listed on their website.

            RSPS stands for RuneScape Private Server, this is a server based on Runescape which is not created by Jagex but by developers 
            who have learned how to program java (programming language), they have been creating Runescape private servers shortly after 
            the release of Runescape. There are many different types of private servers, most of the servers are based on revision 317, 
            this is the oldest revision used by RSPS developers and the most popular one for the RSPS community. Other popular revisions 
            are 474, 508, 525, 562 and 667.
